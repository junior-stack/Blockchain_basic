## 4. How the manager draw winner unsuccessfully

+ The owner cannot draw a lottery within 5 minutes after a new round start. If the owner tries to draw a lottery in less than 5 minutes after the new round starts, he should be able to see the pick a winner button be disabled

+ If nobody is buying the tickets, then the owner cannot draw the winner. Then when the owner clicks the pick a winner button, he will get a window pop up filled with error message



## 5. How to reset the price successfully

1. Switch to the owner account in the part of "How manager draw winner successfully"

2. Click the about button at the home page and go to the organizer page

3. Randomly inputs a new price for the ticket and click reset:

   ![image-20220531194711676](README.assets/image-20220531194711676.png)

   ![image-20220531194739096](README.assets/image-20220531194739096.png)

3. Wait for a moment and then go to the home page. You will see the price is now set to 29:

   ![image-20220531194844161](README.assets/image-20220531194844161.png)





## 6. How to reset the price unsuccessfully

Switch to a non-owner account, you can use your own account. Go to the organizer page

You can see the reset button disabled. If you use a non organizer  and non manager account to go to this page, you will also see the pick a winner button disabled. ![image-20220531195143397](README.assets/image-20220531195143397.png)



Another such situation occurs is that when there has already been users buying the ticket with the old price. Then the owner could not reset the price. For example, when the owner creates a new round and a user buys the ticket with 20 ERC price. Then if the owner resets the price, he will gets a window pop up filled with error message
